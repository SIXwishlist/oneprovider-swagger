 This is the RESTful API definition of Oneprovider component of Onedata data management system [http://www.onedata.org].

 This API provides methods for file management using REST protocol.

 ## Authentication
 In order to be able to use this API the REST client must be able to authenticate with the Oneprovider service.

 Currently this is supported through authentication token which can be generate using the Onedata user interface. 
 The token must be added to the request header:
  - TODO

 In addition please take into account, that depending on your account authorization rights, not all operations
 may be possible.

 ## API structure
 The Oneprovider API reflects the fact that most operations deal directly with virtual file paths relative to
 user spaces, which are provided as part of the paths in the REST calls.
